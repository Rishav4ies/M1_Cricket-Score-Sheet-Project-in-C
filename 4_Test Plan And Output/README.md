In this C projects source code series we are going to create cricket score management system project with C Language.

Cricket scorecard management is an interesting project and a very simple one that can be executed using c programming. The information regarding the runs, name of the players, wickets, and strike rates are stored in this project by using the method of file handling. 

At the execution of this c program, you can see the welcome screen displayed. The main menu that is shown along with the welcome screen has three options like new score sheet, view score sheet, and exit.

When the user press 1, they will be asked to provide the file name under which the data will be stored. You can enter the data after creating the file where the data need to be stored. After you enter the data, you can press 'e' to edit the details in the file or press 'c' to continue further. the user can exit the program, which is the last option provided in the window
